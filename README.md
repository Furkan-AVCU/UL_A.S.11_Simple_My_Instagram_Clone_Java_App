Simple Instagram clone

with this project i learned Firebase transactions and i do some practice
in this project users can sign up and sign in the Minstagram
users can share post with images and comment and all users able to see all posts

I implemented saving data on Firebase and pulling data on Firebase

I added PostAdapter and PostModel. With these things, users can share image posts and comment on UploadActivity and all users can see all posts in FeedActivity.
I am using Picasso library to import image from Firebase to RecyclerView
